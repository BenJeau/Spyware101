# Spyware101
Java spyware program that has a multitude of functionality. Here is a list of them:
* Screen capture
* Record audio from microphone
* Webcam capture 
* Get IP addresses from the system
* Get basic information about the system
* Get the location of the system
* Get wifi passwords from the system
* Get a list of programs installed

These are a few of the functionalities, you can have even more control by executing commands in the user's command prompt.

## Dependencies
This program depends on multiple libraries for its functions. They are already included in this project.

For the location part to work, you need to create an account with MaxMind to get access to the location database. You can create yourself one with this site [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home). In order to infiltrate the program in other computers, I've compiled it as a .jar program that looks like an update for Java, but on execution, there's nothing to be seen.

### Please note
* This software is for learning purposes only and was not created with the intent to harm others.
* The comments and the majority of this program are all in French but will be later on translated to English.
* This spyware is still in development and may not work as expected.
